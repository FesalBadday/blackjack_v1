**Rules :**

- The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
- Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
- Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
- A push is when you and the dealer have the same hand value. When this happens your bet will be returned. You don't win anything and you don't lose anything.
- Hit: Take another card.
- Stand: Take no more cards.
- All In: You play with all of your money.
- Double X2: Increase the initial bet by 100% and take exactly one more card.
- The dealer stands on 18.
- A double is only allowed in the first round.
- Leaderboard: You have to log in to save your scores or you can play as a guest but your scores will not be saved.
- Have fun.
